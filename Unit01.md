**Unit 1: Number Sense** <span id="1"></span> 

*The first unit of this course involves extending your prior knowledge
of fractions and decimals. You will use models to show how the division
equation works. This will help you make sense of finding quotients
involving fractions. During this unit, you will also work with negative
integers along a number line. This might involve negative temperatures
(cold!), having credit or debt with money, or changing elevation as you
hike up a mountain or scuba dive into the ocean. During this
number-sense unit, make your best effort to do just as the unit title
implies - make sense of numbers. Don’t try to memorize equations;
rather, understand the numbers and operations, so you can continue to
make sense of the math in future situations.*

**1.1 Fractions** <span id="1.1"></span> 

*Fractions are used in our daily lives in a variety of ways. The U.S.
customary measurement system uses fractions as a measuring tool
(example: 3/8 inch). Fractions are also used in cooking and baking
(example: 3/4 cup), and fractions can even be used to describe partial
situations (example: I completed 1/4 of the project). These are just a
few general examples of how fractions are used. In this subunit you will
review addition and subtraction of fractions, as well as work with
multiplication and division. These concepts might already be familiar to
you. However, adding models and fluency will be a key concept that you
should focus on while working.*

**1.1.1 Operations with Fractions** <span id="1.1.1"></span> 
**1.1.1.1 Adding and Subtracting Fractions** <span id="1.1.1.1"></span> 

*You and a friend have decided to bake cookies. You both want to make
chocolate chip cookies, but you each have a different recipe. The two of
you decide to have a “bake-off” in order to do a taste test and figure
out which recipe is the best. You plan to go grocery shopping together,
buy everything that you need, and come back to your house to bake the
cookies. Since both recipes call for the same ingredients, just
different amounts of each, you decide to add your amounts together.*

*Adding fractions, as well as subtracting them, is an important concept
to understand when dealing with recipes because most ingredients are
listed as parts of a whole cup.*

**1.1.1.2 Multiplying Fractions** <span id="1.1.1.2"></span> 

*In the previous subunit you combined ingredients before you went to the
store. What happens if you want to double or triple a recipe to make
lots of cookies? This would involve multiplying each ingredient by two
or three. In this subunit you will see that multiplying fractions can be
modeled using a fraction bar. As you work through this subunit, pay
attention to how the fraction models work so you are able to use models
when you multiply fractions.*

    Numbers”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p729tFmpOXg) (YouTube)

    Instructions: While watching this video, pay attention to how the
    instructor changed a whole number into a fraction and how you can
    simplify the fraction after multiplying or before multiplying.
    Sometimes it’s easier to simplify before multiplying because then
    you don’t have to deal with digits that are very large.

    The last 1:20 on the video shows how this problem can also be solved
    using a model. Make sure you recognize how to model multiplication
    of fractions.

    Write a paragraph explaining how the model of a fraction
    multiplication problem works. Your audience is a younger student who
    has never multiplied fractions using a model. Make sure to use math
    vocabulary. Drawing an example model and using arrows/labels might
    be helpful.

    Watching this video, taking notes, and writing a paragraph should
    take you approximately 30 minutes.

    refer to these as additional resources, if needed) until you get to
    “Practice Set A.” In your notebook, complete all problems in the
    practice set. Check the solutions as you go. Make sure to always
    simplify your fraction.

    Complete the problems in “Practice Set B.” Use the “simplify before
    multiplying” strategy. Check the solutions as you go.

    Complete the problem in “Practice Set C.” Remember when you have a
    mixed number you have to convert it to an improper fraction before
    you can use the multiplication formula. Check the solutions as you
    go.

    Skip all parts of “Sample Set D” and “Practice Set D.”

    Continue practicing the problems beginning with “Exercise 28” and

**1.1.1.3 Dividing Fractions** <span id="1.1.1.3"></span> 

*How do you feel about sharing? Sometimes we have to share, or split up,
parts of a whole. Other times, we have to share something that isn’t
whole -  like 2/3 of a leftover pizza shared among four family members.
How much pizza will you get? In this unit you will work to model
division of fractions. It is important to know and use the formula that
works for always dividing fractions. However, make sure you are able to
follow the models given to you in this subunit. Modeling division of
fractions is an important skill to have in this course. *

**1.1.2 Solving Word Problems with Fractions** <span id="1.1.2"></span> 

*Understanding “how to” operate with fractions is important; however,
more importantly you need to know how to put your fraction skills into
real-life situations. When you encounter fractions - whether it’s in
baking, measurement, traveling distances, or just working with parts of
a whole - it is essential that you can define the necessary operation
and put your math skills into action. This subunit will help you break
down word problems and solve them successfully.*

**1.3 Decimals** <span id="1.3"></span> 

*Decimals are used all around us. Most commonly, we use decimals when we
deal with money. It is important to know how to find an exact answer
while using decimals, and to use estimation skills. In this subunit you
will work with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of
decimals. You should have some prior knowledge about decimal placement,
place value with decimals, and saying a decimal number using proper math
grammar (example: 2.35 = two and thirty-five hundredths). If you don’t
feel confident with place value of decimals, do a little research on
your own at this time. An Internet search for “decimal place value”
should give you a good place to start.*

    Link: CK-12: [“Decimal
    Multiplication”](http://www.ck12.org/arithmetic/Decimal-Multiplication/lesson/Decimal-Multiplication/) (HTML)

    Instructions: Read through the text about multiplying decimals.
    Notice that decimal multiplication is not much different from
    regular multiplication. Ignore the decimal until you have the final
    product, and then place the decimal in the proper location. Both
    strategies of “counting decimal places” and “estimation” work for
    knowing where to place the decimal in the product.

    Do the example problems and check your solutions as you read through
    the text.

    Of the four videos accompanying the text, watch the first video
    “James Sousa Multiplying Decimals.” Pause the video at each example,
    solve it on your own, and then check your solution and steps with
    the instructor. (You are welcome to watch the other videos for
    additional practice.)

    Do the practice problems beneath the videos, and check your solution
    on a calculator.

    Reading this article, watching the video, and working through the
    problems should take you approximately 45 minutes.

**1.5 Rational Numbers** <span id="1.5"></span> 

*Using negative numbers in life usually means that it’s very cold
outside (temperatures below zero), you lost points in a game you are
playing, or possibly you are in debt to someone and owe them money.
Knowing and understanding the number line as it extends into negative
numbers is important as you relate the entire rational number system to
your real life.*

    19: Negative Numbers”**

    Link: Cheryl Wilcox’s *Free PreAlgebra*: [“Chapter 4, Lesson 19:
    Negative
    Numbers”](http://home.comcast.net/~cherylwilcox1/Lesson19.pdf) (PDF)

    Instructions: This textbook introduces concepts covered in this
    entire subunit. This is a chance for you to begin to get an
    understanding of rational numbers. Separate your notebook paper into
    three sections. Label the sections “Definitions,” “Real-Life
    Situations,” and “Number Lines.” As you read pages 1 - 5, fill in
    the columns with information from text. These are the vocabulary
    words that you should look for to put in the definitions column:
    negative numbers, positive numbers, opposites, and absolute value.
    In the text, many real-life situations are mentioned, explained, and
    even illustrated with images. The more of these you can learn, the
    more beneficial this text will be to your understanding of rational
    numbers. Under the “Number Lines” column, you should use the type 2
    models to draw a few number lines and plot points to help compare
    greater than and less than.

    Do the entire worksheet on page 6 as practice. You could also do
    practice problems 8 and 9 on the two homework pages, page 8 and page
    12.

    Reading this chapter, taking notes, and working the practice
    problems should take you approximately 30 minutes.
