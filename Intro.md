People sometimes think that math is just about number crunching.
However, that’s not always the case. Patterns and letters
(called variables) are used in math to help represent real-life
situations. In addition to learning about variables, parts of this
course will help you see a side of math you might not have even realized
is out there. This course includes six units. Topics covered include
multiplication and division of fractions, ratio reasoning, unit rates,
expressions, equations, area, surface area, volume, and statistics. As
you work through the six units, you will notice that some of the
material builds on your prior knowledge, while some of the concepts will
be new ideas that will serve as building blocks for your future math
career. In unit 1, you will build on your current understanding of
fractions, multiplication, and division to understand why the procedures
for multiplying and dividing fractions make sense. The number system in
its basic sense is probably already familiar to you. During this unit,
you will move your understanding to the full system of rational numbers,
particularly negative integers. Connecting ideas about multiplication
and division will be beneficial as you start learning to solve ratio and
rate problems in unit 2. You will discover that there is a wide range of
real-life situations modeled with unit rates that can be used beyond
this math course. While working through unit 2, you will learn how to
solve for, and work with, percentages. Writing expressions and equations
are the big ideas in unit 3. This is a building-block unit to start your
foundational understanding of algebra. Learning about variables and
mathematical properties in this unit will help you construct a sense of
how mathematicians describe relationships between quantities. In unit 4,
you will build on your work with area by reasoning about relationships
among shapes to determine area, surface area, and volume. You will also
develop formulas to use while working with geometric shapes. During unit
5, you will extend your understanding of the coordinate plane to include
all four quadrants. You will plot points, draw polygons, and solve
real-life problems that involve graphing. Finally, in unit 6, you will
learn about statistics. During this unit, you will explore visual
representations so you can compare/contrast measures of center and
measures of variability. Throughout this entire course, the goal is for
you to understand each topic before you move forward. As you encounter
real-life situational problems, strive to make sense of the
circumstances and how they would fit into your life.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:  

-   Compute multiplication and division of fractions.
-   Fluently compute with multi-digit numbers and find common factors
    and multiples.
-   Understand ratio concepts and use ratio reasoning to solve problems.
-   Extend ideas of the number system to include negative integers.
-   Write, evaluate, and solve for algebraic expressions, one-step
    equations, and inequalities.
-   Solve real-world situational problems using area, surface area, and
    volume.
-   Develop an understanding of statistical variability.
-   Summarize and describe variability.

### Course Requirements

 √   Have access to a computer.  
  
 √   Have continuous broadband Internet access.  
  
 √   Have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software (e.g.,
Adobe Reader or Flash).  
  
 √   Have the ability to download and save files and documents to a
computer.

.xls, etc.).  
  
 √   Have competency in the English language.

### Course Information

**Welcome to Math 6.** General information about this course and its
requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Course Designer:** [Ms. Kelly
Quinn](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-o-t/#MsKellyQuinn)  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   [Henrico County Public
    Schools](http://teachers.henrico.k12.va.us/math/HCPSAlgebra1/index.html)
-   [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
-   [Illustrative Mathematics](http://www.illustrativemathematics.org/)
-   James Sousa’s [Mathispower4u](http://mathispower4u.yolasite.com/)
-   [CK12](http://www.ck12.org/student/)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
These assigned materials include readings, videos, exercises, tasks,
checkpoints, and a final exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the other assignments listed above.  
    
 In order to "pass" this course, you will need to earn a grade of 70% or
higher on the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as
soon as you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it
again.  
  
 **Time Commitment: **Completing this course should take you a total of
approximately **58 hours**. Each unit includes a time advisory that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. It
may be useful to take a look at these time advisories and determine how
much time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit and to
then set goals for yourself. For example, unit 1 should take
approximately 13 hours. It may be helpful to sit down with your calendar
and decide, for example, to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 5 hours and
15 minutes) over the course of 5 nights, working for about an hour each
night.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** It would be helpful to have a notebook or binder
for all the materials you will complete in this course. As you read or
watch videos, take careful notes on a separate sheet of paper. Mark down
any important ideas, formulas, and definitions that stand out to you. It
will be useful to use all of this work as a review prior to completing
the final exam.  
    
 While you are working through the course, focus on understanding what
you are doing. The early material creates the tools that you will use in
later sections, so make sure you do not skip over it. Solutions are
included in most exercises to check your work and to serve as a learning
tool. When you answer incorrectly or have trouble with a problem, you
can use the provided solutions to work backward to understand the
process. When you are struggling with a topic even after exploring all
the given resources, searching the web for additional assistance or
visiting some of the above sites for supplemental explanations or
practice would be very useful.
