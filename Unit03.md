**Unit 3: Expressions and Equations** <span id="3"></span> 

*Have you ever noticed that patterns are found everywhere? We use
expressions and equations to put those patterns into mathematical
sentences. Comparing the equations allows people to recognize how one
pattern compares to another. For example, if you have a cell phone, you
or a parent might have done some “comparison shopping” before signing up
for the plan. Without even knowing it, you used an equation to compare.
If you and your friends want to rent bicycles while on vacation, you
might use an equation to figure out how much it would cost for eight
friends to rent bikes. You’d use the same equation if only five friends
plan to rent. Equations and expressions involve variables, which helps
open lots of doors into algebra. While working through this unit, you
will be constructing the basic building blocks of algebra, which is
important to your mathematical future. *

**3.1 Exponents** <span id="3.1"></span> 

*When students first learn about multiplication, teachers often relate
it to addition. Perhaps you have heard the phrase “multiplication is
repeated addition.” An exponent is similar because an exponent helps
mathematicians represent repeated multiplication. This subunit will
teach you about how to solve for and write exponents.*

-   **Explanation: YouTube: Mathispower4u: James Sousa’s “Exponential
    Notation”**

    Link: YouTube: Mathispower4u: James Sousa’s [“Exponential
    Notation”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_Eb5FsgJLY) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Watch the video about exponential notation. Take
    notes on the 2nd slide (0:20). There is important vocabulary in red
    text that you will want to take notes on. As you watch, pay
    attention to how the instructor uses those vocabulary words
    throughout the video. The slide starting at 1:19 is also very
    valuable; notice that multiple ways to verbally say x2 and x3 exist.
    You want to be familiar with both “x squared” and “x to the second
    power.”

    Starting at 3:13, the instructor begins evaluating some exponents.
    At this time, you only need to be able to do and understand \#1.
    Feel free to watch him solve the other three examples; do not worry
    if the negative numbers or the multiplying with a variable are
    confusing. You will learn those concepts throughout your math
    career.

    Watching this video and taking notes should take you approximately
    15 minutes.

**3.2 Order of Operations** <span id="3.2"></span> 

*Mathematicians have a set of rules called order of operations; the
rules help everyone know what steps to take when solving a set of
numbers. As a mathematician you need to know these rules and how to
apply them because you will find that you need them for both simple and
complex problems you will encounter.*

-   **Explanation: CK-12: “Order of Operations”**

    Link: CK-12: [“Order of
    Operations”](http://www.ck12.org/section/Order-of-Operations/) (HTML)

    Instructions: Read about Keisha and counting birds. Take notes about
    the difference between an equation and an expression. You will
    continue to use those two words throughout this unit. Take notes
    about order of operations. This will be an important concept to
    remember whenever you are solving number sentences.

    It’s often helpful to work the problems step-by-step to help
    organize your information. A benefit to organizing your work
    step-by-step is if you make a mistake, it’s easy to go back and
    figure out where the mistake was made. If you try to do mental math,
    you might end up with an incorrect answer. If you have not shown all
    your work, finding your error will be hard.

    Look at the example problem below. The student first wrote out the
    entire problem, then solved the exponent operation and re-wrote the
    entire problem with just the 42 solved. The next step was to see
    that multiplication comes next, so the third line shows everything
    written out with the 5 x 2 solved. Now the student is ready to
    add/subtract from left to right. The fourth line shows the first
    addition part solved with the remaining number sentence staying the
    same. The final two lines show the last two operations solved as
    they show up left to right. The number sentence gets shorter with
    each line because the student solves one operation and then
    re-writes everything else just as it was given in the problem.  
      
      **3 +  <span>4<sup>2</sup> – 5 x 2 + 9</span>**

    **3 + 16 – 5 x 2 + 9**

    **3 + 16 – 10 + 9**

    **19 – 10 + 9**

    **9 + 9**

    **18**

    Continue doing the examples. In section III, you will get to be a
    math detective. Take time to check each of Joaquin’s problems and
    make sure he followed the proper steps. Do all example problems.
    Write down any vocabulary words that you have not already added to
    your notebook.

    Watch the videos. Notice how the instructors show each of their
    steps as they work through the problem. Try to solve the expression
    before the instructor so you can check your work. Pause the video
    while you are working.

    Work the “Time to Practice” problems for additional review.

    Taking notes, watching the videos, and working through the examples
    should take you approximately 1 hour.

**3.3 Expressions** <span id="3.3"></span> 

*Remember in subunit 3.2 when you learned about the different between an
equation and an expression? Now you are going to focus on expressions
and how to evaluate expressions that involve variables (a variable is a
letter representing a number). Expressions can represent situations that
happen in your daily life. For example, as you will see in the first
resource, an expression can be used to figure out a weekly paycheck
based on the number of hours someone works. *

    Instructions: Read about Lydia and Bart working part time jobs.
    Think about the steps that would go into solving this initial
    question. Continue reading and taking notes under the “Guidance”
    section. Solve the examples step-by-step on paper (not just
    mentally); the process of substituting numbers for variables and
    remembering to follow the order of operations shouldn’t be something
    that is rushed. Continue doing all the guided practice, watch the
    short video, and complete the practice problems.

    Reading, taking notes, and practicing this concept should take you
    approximately 30 minutes.

    Instructions: Read about Jeremy wanting to covert a phrase into
    algebra. Continue reading about algebraic expressions and completing
    the examples. Watch the first video about patterns.

    Extra Challenge: The second video takes these concepts to a
    higher-than-sixth-grade level. Feel free to watch it to “see where
    you are going” in math. However, don’t get overwhelmed or
    intimidated. The video uses equations instead of expressions. The
    rules and ideas are the same, but since the instructor is solving
    for a specific day, we use an equal sign.

    Reading and watching the first video take should take you
    approximately 15 minutes.

**3.4 Equations** <span id="3.4"></span> 

*Solving an equation is like answering a question. Remember, an equation
is going to have an equal sign. Think of the equal sign as a balance
beam. Both sides are equivalent, and sometimes you have to work
backwards, or undo, one operation to figure out the unknown value (the
variable). In this subunit you will use substitution, like you did with
expressions - the concepts are the same.*

    Instructions: Read the introduction and “Guidance” section. Take
    notes on the bold words and information as you read. The question in
    example A is a different type of question than in examples B and C.
    You should feel comfortable being able to write equations as well as
    using the substitution method to check if a specific value for a
    variable results in a solution. 

    Listen to the first 30 seconds of the video. Pause it, and try to
    write and solve the equation before continuing with the video. Watch
    the remainder of the video so see if your equation and solving
    method matched the solution. As the second example begins playing,
    stop the video at the 2:15 mark. See if you can write and solve an
    equation for the verbal expression before continuing the video.

    Complete the exercises under the “Guided Practice” section, and
    check your work with the given solutions. Stop there. Do not
    continue with the next video or practice problems.

    Taking notes, completing the practice problems, and watching the
    video should take you approximately 30 minutes.

**3.5 Inequality** <span id="3.5"></span> 

*Have you ever solved a math problem where there was more than one
correct answer? Perhaps you were considering the minimum number of lawns
you needed to mow to buy a new skateboard. You might conclude that
mowing more than nine lawns would get you an adequate amount of money.
This means the correct answer for how many lawns to mow would be
anything larger than nine. This is where you would use an inequality. An
inequality is like an equation, but the equal sign is replaced with a
greater-than symbol or a less-than symbol. You probably have experience
with greater-than (\>) and less-than symbols (\<). There are often
infinite possible solutions for some inequalities (and sometimes there
are no solutions at all!). The rules of substitution and variables
remain generally the same.*

    “Overview” and “Graphing Inequalities” (HTML)

    Instructions: This page will give you a really good summary of what
    an inequality is and how to apply it. Read the “Overview” section;
    take notes of each of the words in blue font. Read through the
    examples, taking additional notes as you go. Do practice problems
    1 - 11 (you can check answers 8 - 11).

    In the “Graphing Inequalities” section, read and take notes.
    Especially note the symbols and circles (shaded or not shaded) in
    the outlined boxes. This is very important to graphing inequalities
    on a number line. Read through the examples, and complete practice
    problems 12 - 19.

    Stop there for now. We will return to this page in the next subunit.

    Reading this selection, taking notes, and completing the practice
    problems should take you approximately 30 minutes.
