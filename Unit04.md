**Unit 4: Geometry** <span id="4"></span> 

*Did you ever play with shape blocks when you were younger? Possibly you
put a triangle next to a rectangle and then added a square on a
different side. Do you know how to find the area of this new shape? In
this unit, you will use your prior knowledge about area, as well as some
new information that we will cover, to help you decompose a complicated
shape into smaller polygons in order to successfully find the area of
the total shape. During this unit, you will also solve problems with
three-dimensional shapes and work with a variety of real-life
situations.*

**4.1 One-, Two-, and Three-Dimensional Measurements** <span
id="4.1"></span> 

*Our world is three-dimensional. You can pick up objects up and hold
them in your hand. When you look at a three-dimensional object, you can
see that it has length, width, and height/depth. However, we also use
one- and two- dimensions in our world, as well. One-dimensional objects
are just lines, or lengths; for example, neighborhoods separate family
property by a one-dimensional boundary. People often measure the length
of their property line and build a fence. The fence itself is
three-dimensional; however, the length of the fence is one-dimensional.*

*Two-dimensional refers to something that has a length and a width. When
you look at a photograph, go to a movie, or watch television, you are
viewing objects as two-dimensional (assuming you don’t have the special
3-D glasses). The walls in your bedroom might need painting. You could
measure the length and width of the walls to calculate how much paint to
buy. A wall is two-dimensional because it’s flat.*

*When you walk around in your everyday life, think about how people use
one-, two-, and three-dimensional measurements. *

    Instructions: Using this resource as a guide, you will create a
    table to help you learn about dimensional measurements. In your
    notebook, separate a page into three columns. Your paper should look
    similar to the one you see in the attached link. Title each column
    “One-Dimensional,” “Two-Dimensional,” and “Three-Dimensional.” Use
    the 4.1 subunit introduction, your prior knowledge, and the
    resources in this unit to add ideas about working with each
    dimension. It will be helpful to go back and refer to this table as
    you work through geometry units.

    Setting up your notebook and beginning to fill in this chart should
    take you approximately 15 minutes.

    Link: Khan Academy’s [“Perimeter and Area
    Basics”](http://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/basic-geometry/perimeter_area_tutorial/v/perimeter-and-area-basics) (YouTube)

    Instructions: The video starts off showing you how to find the
    perimeter of a rectangle. This is probably a review of your prior
    knowledge. While you watch, draw the shapes and find the perimeter
    of the rectangles in the video. Remember, perimeter is a
    one-dimensional measurement because it’s a single line going around
    an object.

    The second part of the video discusses area. Remember, area is a
    two-dimensional measurement because it has a length and width. When
    we find area, we use the label square units or units2 because we can
    actually cover our shape with squares and count them to find the
    area, as demonstrated in the video. Take notes while the instructor
    finds the areas of the rectangles.

    Watching this video and taking notes should take you approximately
    15 minutes.

**4.2 Area** <span id="4.2"></span> 

*This subunit focuses specifically on finding the area of a variety of
shapes. Remember, area is measured in square units or units2. You will
use different formulas to find area based on the shape you are working
with. Try not to get too caught up in memorizing formulas. It is
actually much easier if you stop and think about the shape and a
strategy that would make sense for finding its area. The resources in
this unit will help you with these strategies. This subunit will give
you a chance to add notes to your “Two-Dimensional” column in your
notebook.*

**4.2.1 Triangles** <span id="4.2.1"></span> 

*As you work through the resources in this subunit, really focus on how
you can understand and not just memorize the formula for the area of a
triangle. Even though there are different types of triangles, you will
discover how similar the strategies are for finding the area.*

-   **Explanation: Khan Academy’s “Triangle Area Proof”**

    Link: Khan Academy’s [“Triangle Area
    Proof”](http://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/basic-geometry/perimeter_area_tutorial/v/triangle-area-proofs) (YouTube)

    Instructions: Draw a right triangle in your notebook. Follow along
    with the strategy to make the triangle into a rectangle. Notice how
    your triangle is exactly half of the rectangle you drew around it.
    Copy the formula that fits with this strategy used in the video.

    Continue watching the “proof” for how to find the area of the other
    types of triangles shown in the video. Draw each triangle with the
    instructor. Consider how you can use the same strategy of drawing
    rectangles around triangles to find the area of any triangle.

    It is OK to refer to the formula A = bh (area = x base x height)
    when dealing with triangles. However, you should be able to explain
    why that formula works.

    Watching this video and taking notes should take you approximately
    30 minutes.

**4.2.3 Composite Figures** <span id="4.2.3"></span> 

*Picture a square and a triangle pushed up together to share a side
length. This is called a composite figure. A composite figure is a
figure that is made of a variety of shapes. When you are asked to find
the perimeter of a composite figure, keep in mind that perimeter is the
distance around an object. It is sometimes helpful to take your pencil
and trace the outside of the object; you will need to add each of those
side lengths together to find the perimeter. When finding the area of a
composite figure, think about how you can break the object into smaller,
separate shapes. Once you’ve done that, you will find the area of the
smaller shapes. Then, you will add the individual areas together.
Sometimes, side lengths won’t be given, but clues within the problem or
the shape can help you figure out the missing side length. *

    Link: CK-12: [“Area of Composite
    Shapes”](http://www.ck12.org/geometry/Area-of-Composite-Shapes/lesson/Area-of-Composite-Shapes/) (HTML)

    Instructions: This lesson will provide you with a few videos to
    explain how to find the area of composite shapes. Begin watching the
    first video. Pause the video so you can take the time to draw the
    shape. Solve for the area of the composite shape with the
    instructor. Note: at the 1:40 mark in the video, the instructor
    figures that the height of the triangle is 3. Do not worry about the
    process used to find the height. You will learn about that later in
    your math career.

    Scroll down to the second video and begin watching. Pause the video
    to draw the shape. Try to find the area of the composite figure
    before the instructor. Watch the instructor’s process. Complete the
    next composite shape with the same process.

    Complete practice problems 1 - 15 at the end of the lesson.

    Watching these videos and completing the practice problems should
    take you approximately 45 minutes.

    Instructions: Look at the composite figure. Pause the video. Draw
    the shape and find the area - remember to split the composite figure
    into smaller rectangles. To find the length of the missing sides,
    use the other side lengths given to you. Do not estimate, measure,
    or guess side lengths! Watch the remainder of the video to compare
    your strategy to the instructor’s. Could you have split your
    composite figure into rectangles in a different way than the
    instructor did, while still finding the area to be the same?

    the star shape on your paper. Try to find the perimeter based on the
    information given to you. Watch the instructor as he explains how to
    find the star perimeter. Compare your strategy to his.

    Pause the video at 2:40. Think about how you can find the area of
    this shape. Break it into two smaller shapes. Draw the composite
    figure and find the area. If you are struggling, watch another 1:00
    to see a good first step in solving for this area. Once you have
    found the area, watch the instructor as he continues explaining how
    to find the area of the composite figure. Compare your strategy to
    his.

    Pause the video at 5:20. Draw the shape. Label the given side
    lengths. Think about how you find the other side lengths (without
    guessing, estimating, or measuring). If you need a hint, watch the
    video for another 1:10 and see what the instructor’s strategy is
    with the side lengths. If you feel confident, pause the video again
    at 6:30 and find the perimeter. Watch the remainder of the video to
    see how the instructor finds the perimeter.

    Watching this video and working through the example problems should

    into smaller rectangles. To find the length of the missing sides,
    use the other side lengths given to you. Do not estimate, measure,
    or guess side lengths! Watch the remainder of the video to compare
    your strategy to the instructor’s. Could you have split your
    composite figure into rectangles in a different way than the
    instructor did, while still finding the area to be the same?

    Completing this problem should take you approximately 15 minutes.

**4.3 Surface Area** <span id="4.3"></span> 

*Have you ever wrapped a gift for someone? You have to make sure you cut
off enough wrapping paper so that it covers the entire gift. The box
that gift is in is a three-dimensional box; in math it would be called a
rectangular prism (although you might just think of it as a shoebox).
The wrapping paper covers the gift - each side, or face, of the box is a
two-dimensional surface. To figure out how much wrapping paper is
needed, mathematicians find the surface area. This subunit focuses on
how to find surface area and introduces you important vocabulary you
need to know when dealing with two- and three-dimensional objects. This
subunit will give you a chance to add notes to your “Two-Dimensional”
and “Three-Dimensional” columns in your notebook.*

**4.3.1 Nets** <span id="4.3.1"></span> 
-   **Explanation: Explanation: CK-12: “Surface Area of Prisms”**

    Link: CK-12: [“Surface Area of
    Prisms”](http://www.ck12.org/geometry/Surface-Area-of-Prisms/lesson/Surface-Area-of-Prisms/) (HTML)

    Instructions: The purpose of this lesson is to help you learn some
    vocabulary concerning two- and three-dimensional measurements. While
    you read through the lesson, do not focus on the mathematical
    computations; you will work on the math a little later.

    Read the introduction. In the “Guidance” section, take notes on
    words such as **three-dimensional, prism, surface area,** and
    **net.** After the third “sticky note” with a net on it, skip down
    to examples A, B, and C. Go through each true/false question.

    Skip down to the “Vocabulary” section. Make sure you have each of
    the vocabulary words clearly defined in your notebook.

    If you can, cut out a net from a piece of your notebook paper (or
    graph paper if you have it). Fold the net to form a
    three-dimensional rectangular prism or cube. Tape your rectangular
    prism together and use it as an example as you continue through this
    unit.

    Taking notes and building a net should take you approximately 45
    minutes.

**4.3.2 Parts of a Three-Dimensional Object** <span id="4.3.2"></span> 
-   **Explanation: CK-12: “Faces, Edges, and Vertices of Solids”**

    Link: CK-12: [“Faces, Edges, and Vertices of
    Solids”](http://www.ck12.org/geometry/Faces-Edges-and-Vertices-of-Solids/lesson/Faces-Edges-and-Vertices-of-Solids/) (HTML)

    Instructions: This lesson will give you some more vocabulary as you
    work with three-dimensional objects. As you read the “Guidance”
    section, take notes on the vocabulary words: **faces, edges,** and
    **vertices**.

    Draw a rectangular prism, or use an actual object that you can point
    to and label - a shoebox or even a computer are examples of a
    rectangular prism. Objects are often described by their number of
    faces, edges, or vertices. The word face is used when finding
    surface area (see subunit 4.3.3), so make sure you understand these
    vocabulary words.

    Complete the examples, read through and take notes on the
    “Vocabulary” section (you will not be expected to know about a
    cylinder, pyramid, cone, or sphere as a sixth-grade student), and
    complete the “Guided Practice” questions.

    Watch the video for another view of how to label faces, edges, and
    vertices. Complete problems 1 - 7 in the “Practice” section.

    Taking notes, completing the practice problems, and watching the
    video should take you approximately 30 minutes.

    Instructions: Read through the introduction about wrapping the doll
    house. Take notes as you read through the “Guidance” section. Solve
    the example problems given to you. Draw both a rectangular prism and
    a net for each problem. This will help you recognize how a
    two-dimensional net is related to a three-dimensional rectangular
    prism. The formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism is
    long and complex. However, write it down and think about how each
    part related to the actual shape.

    Write down the vocabulary words, and then continue on to the “Guided
    Practice” section. Watch the video provided. Notice there is not a
    lid on the box. This takes away an entire face.

    Answer questions 1 - 10 in the “Practice” section.

    Taking notes, watching the video, and completing the practice
    problems should take you approximately 1 hour.

**4.4 Volume** <span id="4.4"></span> 

*Remember the gift you were wrapping in the previous subunit? What’s
inside? How do you know if you have a box that is big enough for the
object you are wrapping? Whenever you are thinking about the space
inside of something, you are dealing with volume. Volume is a
three-dimensional measurement because it has a length, width and a
height (recall the one-dimensional measurement has only a length;
two-dimensional measurements have a length and a width). Volume adds a
third dimension - height, or sometimes called depth. Have you ever been
to a swimming pool? The amount of water in the pool is the volume. Have
you ever crammed your suitcase full of clothes before you went on a
trip? The amount of stuff inside your luggage is volume. This subunit
focuses on how to find volume and will give you important vocabulary for
dealing with volume. This subunit will give you a chance to add notes to
your “Three-Dimensional” column in your notebook.*

    Cubes”](http://www.ck12.org/geometry/Volume-of-Prisms-Using-Unit-Cubes/lesson/Volume-of-Prisms-Using-Unit-Cubes/) (HTML)

    Instruction: Read through and take notes on the “Guidance” section.
    Notice the label for volume is in cubic units or units3 because
    volume involves counting the cubes to fill an object. Complete the
    problems in the “Examples” section in your notebook, take notes on
    the “Vocabulary” (as a sixth-grade student you do not need to know
    triangular prisms), and complete the “Guided Practice” sections.
    Stop there for now. You will do some practice with unit cubes in the
    next resource.

    Reading this lesson and taking notes should take you approximately
    30 minutes.

    Instructions: As you read through the introduction, notice that
    Candice and Trevor are “filling” their boxes with the packing
    peanuts. When you see the word “fill” you can often know that the
    problem involves volume. Continue reading and take notes on the
    “Guidance” section. Draw some rectangular prisms (do your best with
    three-dimensional drawing), label each side “length,” “width,” and
    “height.” As you read you will notice there are two formulas. Make
    sure you not only know how to use each formula, but that you also
    know the difference between them and can explain how they work.
    Continue with the example problems, vocabulary, and guided practice.
    In the “Practice” section, complete problems 1 - 10. Draw and label
    a rectangular prism for at least half of the practice problems to
    get an image of how the prism looks.

    Reading this lesson, taking notes, and completing the practice
    problems should take you approximately 45 minutes.

    Instructions: As you read this problem, keep in mind that you will
    need to do some converting of units before you work to find the
    height of the tank. A good strategy to consider is that although the
    problem is talking about water, volume is measured in cubed units.
    Think about the amount of space the first layer (height of 1 cm)
    takes up. Consider that you will need to see how many 50 cm by 60 cm
    layers should be stacked to fill the tank full. Scroll down and read
    the commentary and the solution on the second page.

**4.5 Real-Life Situations and Word Problems Involving Geometric
Shapes** <span id="4.5"></span> 

*Painting your bedroom walls, filling a swimming pool with water,
planting grass seed in the yard, and wrapping a gift are just a few
examples of real-life situations when you will use geometry.
Understanding how to find perimeter, area, surface area, and volume are
all very important. However, the initial task is to know what the
question is asking and to understand what type of formula will be used.
As you go through this subunit, stop and think about each situation.
Consider key words that might trigger ideas to know if you are dealing
with one-, two-, or three-dimensional measurements. This subunit will
give you a chance to use the notes from your notebook. You can also add
additional real-life examples to each of the columns in your notebook.*
