**Unit 5: Coordinate Graphing** <span id="5"></span> 

*Graphing on a coordinate grid helps label points in space. In this
unit, you will extend the coordinate grid beyond quadrant I (x, y) and
work in all four quadrants. This unit will cover some of your prior
learning from earlier in this course by using negative integers and
polygons. *

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 5 hours.

☐ Subunit 5.1: 3 hours and 45 minutes

☐ Subunit 5.2: 1 hour and 15 minutes

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:

-   Extend the coordinate axis in the plane with negative number
    coordinates.

-   Understand that signs in a coordinate pair indicate the location of
    the point in a quadrant.

-   Find and position pairs on a coordinate plane.

-   Recognize the location of two ordered pairs that differ only by
    signs.

-   Draw polygons on a coordinate plane when given coordinates for the
    vertices.

-   Use sets of coordinate pairs to find side lengths for a polygon that
    is graphed on the coordinate plane.

-   Recognize and solve real-world problems that involve graphing points
    in all four quadrants.

**5.1 Understanding Four-Quadrant Graphing** <span id="5.1"></span> 

*Graphs are used to show trends, organize maps, and represent data. This
unit will focus on extending the coordinate plane to include negative
coordinates. When coordinates are negative mathematicians use what is
called a four-quadrant graph. It is not different from the normal x-axis
and y-axis that you are used to; it is just an extension of those lines
in a negative direction.*

*It is very helpful if you have a stack of graph paper as you complete
this unit. Graph paper can be found in most office supply stores as well
as can be printed off the Internet if you have access to a printer. *

**5.1.1 Coordinates within the Quadrants** <span id="5.1.1"></span> 

*In subunit 1.5 you learned about integers (negative and positive
numbers) and plotted them on a number line. Similarly, the quadrant
graphing extends into the negative numbers, as well. In this subunit you
will learn about the four quadrants involved in graphing.*

    Quadrants”](http://www.ck12.org/algebra/Ordered-Pairs-in-Four-Quadrants/lesson/Ordered-Pairs-in-Four-Quadrants/) (HTML)

    Instructions: Read about Josh drawing a graph of where he lives in
    relation to school. Continue to read and take notes in the
    “Guidance” section. The basic graphing will probably be review for
    you. Do the example problems given to you.

    One strategy to use as you work on graphing a coordinate pair is
    that you always “run before you jump/dig.” That means you will
    always move right/left along the x-axis with the first number given
    to you, before you will move up or down (jump/dig) along the y-axis.

    Make sure you have the vocabulary words written down in your
    notebook. Watch the video and complete the “Guided Practice”
    section.

    Taking notes, doing examples, and watching the video will take you
    approximately 30 minutes.

    Instructions: Watch the video and take notes about the different
    quadrants and how to graph pairs of integers. It is good to know the
    names (numbers) of the quadrants; however, it is more important to
    understand how to graph on a four-quadrant coordinate plane.

    Watching this video and taking notes should take you approximately
    15 minutes.

    coordinate pair. It is most important that you understand that the
    first coordinate is the x-coordinate and the second coordinate is
    the y-coordinate. One strategy to help with this is that “x” comes
    before “y” in the alphabet.

        four-quadrant plane. How are they the same and how are they
        different? Where do you find negative numbers on a number line
        versus on a four-quadrant plane?
    -   The final paragraph should be some real-world examples where a
        four-quadrant plane could be helpful or is used.

    Completing the practice problems and writing a letter should take
    you approximately 45 minutes.

    Link: Khan Academy’s [“Reflecting
    Points”](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/linear-equations-and-inequalitie/coordinate-plane/e/reflecting-points) (HTML)

    Instructions: In a previous unit, you learned about the opposite of
    a number. For example, the opposite of 3 is -3. The opposite of 10
    is -10. In this resource, you will use opposites as you reflect
    coordinates over the x-axis or y-axis. When a coordinate pair is
    reflected over the x-axis, the x-coordinate remains the same while
    the y-coordinate is transformed into its opposite. More
    specifically, if you were asked to reflect (5, 9) over the x-axis,
    the result would be (5, -9). Reflect means to flip. A good hint if
    you forget the rules for reflections when graphing, simply fold your
    graph paper along the line of reflection (in this example the
    x-axis) to see where your new coordinate will be located. This will
    allow you to see what is happening to the coordinates and help you
    remember the rule.

    This specific resource provides a series of practice problems that
    you can answer and check online. Each question has a solution worked
    out step-by-step if you need hints along the way. Practice the
    reflected coordinates questions until you feel confident that you
    understand how to successfully reflect a coordinate pair over an
    axis (recommended a minimum of 10 minutes of practice). It might be
    helpful to use your graph paper to graph the point given to you and
    fold your paper at the line of reflection; this will show you the
    resulting coordinate pair.

    Completing these practice problems should take you approximately 15
    minutes.

    Map”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/K12MATH6-Task-Outdoor-Ed.pdf) (PDF)

    Instruction: Scroll about halfway down the page. In the last section
    of the sixth-grade standards, download “6.NS.8 Outdoor Ed.doc.” Read
    about how to set up the stations around camp. If you have access to
    a printer, print off page 3 of this document. If you do not have a
    printer, do your best to recreate the camp grid found on page 3 on
    your own graph paper.

    -   Plot the coordinates for the amenities, these are found on the
        bottom of page 1.
    -   Plot the stations using the considerations in the “Task” section
        on the first page.
    -   Answer the questions in the “Follow-Up Questions” section found
        on page 2. Note that although there are only questions numbered
        1 - 4, there are often multiple questions for each numbered
        question. Be detailed when answering each question.
    -   Check your answer for the outdoor camp grid and follow-up
        questions on pages 4 - 6. If you have something incorrect, go
        back to your grid and fix it so that it is graphed correctly.

    Plotting the coordinates, answering the questions, and checking your
    solutions should take you approximately 1 hour.

**5.2 Geometry on a Coordinate Plane** <span id="5.2"></span> 

*The coordinate plane and all four quadrants are often used to plot the
corners, or vertices, of shapes. In this unit you will plot the
coordinates to create shapes. You will also work the find the side
lengths of the shapes by using the coordinate plane grid.*

    Instructions: Read about Josh using a coordinate plane as a map. In
    this resource you will graph the vertices of a shape on the
    coordinate plane and connect the points to create the given shape.
    Read through the “Guidance” section. Take notes and do the example
    problems on your own graph paper.

    Check that you have all the vocabulary words written down in your
    notebook. Complete the questions in the “Guided Practice” section
    and begin watching the video. The video will be review, but it is
    helpful to listen/watch someone else explains in addition to reading
    about graphing. Feel free to stop the video at the 5:23 mark. The
    instructor continues on about graphing calculators. This is not a
    sixth-grade standard; however, if you are interested in learning
    more about graphing calculators, he does a good job of explaining
    how to use a calculator to plot coordinates.

    Finish by completing the problems in the “Practice” section.

    Taking notes, watching the video, and completing the practice
    problems should take you approximately 30 minutes.
